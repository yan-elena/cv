        \par \faGithub \url{https://github.com/yan-elena/agent-logging}
        \par \faGithub \url{https://github.com/yan-elena/agent-explanation}
        \par The aim of the project is to provide a multi-level vision of explainability for a BDI Multi Agent Systems that encompasses both low-level aspects for inspecting and debugging purposes for developers, as well as high-level aspects for exploring and understanding the system's behaviour for end-users. The project is realized for the Master's Degree Thesis.

\entry*[05/2023 - 06/2023] \textbf{Grammatical Error Correction}
        \par \textbf{Subject:} Deep learning
        \par The aim of the project is to evaluate the performance of several deep learning models on the Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) task, which consists to transform a potentially wrong input sentence into a corrected version.

\entry*[07/2022 - 10/2022] \textbf{SmartGH}
        \par \faGithub \url{https://github.com/AnnaVitali/PPS-22-smartgh}
        \par \textbf{Subject:} Programming and Development paradigms
        \par The aim of the project is to simulate the management of an intelligent greenhouse, able to interact with the environment in which it is located through sensors that detect relevant parameters for plant growth and receive updates on external environmental conditions.

\entry*[04/2022 - 06/2022] \textbf{Talking Campus}
        \par \faGithub \url{https://bitbucket.org/ele-anna/talkingcampus/src/master/}
        \par \textbf{Subject:} Web Applications and Services
        \par The aim of this project is to provide students with information on campus locations and spaces, giving them the possibility to view lectures, and free and occupied classrooms and to manage reservations of places in study rooms or the library. 
        \par \textbf{Keywords:} MERN, Socket.io, React, MongoDB, Docker
